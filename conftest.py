"""Root conftest — prevent real notifications from leaking during tests.

This patches the I/O layer (urlopen, subprocess.run) inside shared.notify
so that tests which exercise the engine/delivery path without explicit mocks
cannot send real ntfy or desktop notifications.

Tests that explicitly mock these functions (e.g. test_notify.py) will see
their own mocks take precedence over this session-scoped patch.
