Target total: {target_words} words (for {target_seconds}s at 150 words/minute)
DEFICIT: {words_needed} words — you MUST add this many words.
Minimum per scene: {words_per_scene} words. COUNT THEM. If a scene narration is under {words_per_scene} words, it WILL be rejected.
Intro: 15-30 words MAXIMUM (plays over static title card). Outro: 15-30 words MAXIMUM.
Put substantive content in scene narrations, NOT in intro/outro.

YOUR PREVIOUS REVISION WAS TOO SHORT. Each scene narration must be a FULL PARAGRAPH of 5-8 sentences.
A single scene narration should look like this (notice the length):
"The dashboard shows the health of all seventy-eight components in the stack. Each one has a status indicator, and right now they're all green. The daily briefing section is generated automatically at seven AM — it summarizes which scheduled tasks ran, whether any services needed attention, and flags anything unusual. The health monitor runs every fifteen minutes across seventeen check groups, and it can auto-fix about half the common failures without any intervention. Below that is the cost tracker, which breaks down cloud API spending by model and service. The whole design principle is that the system surfaces what matters and handles what it can, so the operator only gets pulled in when something genuinely requires a decision."

That example is ~130 words. EVERY scene needs this level of detail. Do NOT write 2-3 sentence narrations.

HOW TO EXPAND:
- Start with what this feature/capability IS (1-2 sentences)
- Give a SPECIFIC example from daily use (2-3 sentences)
- Explain WHY it matters or what problem it solves (1-2 sentences)
- Add a personal reflection or comparison (1 sentence)

## VISUAL VARIETY FIX (CRITICAL — THIS MUST BE FIXED)

Problem: 3+ consecutive screenshot scenes starting at scene {consecutive_start}. This makes the demo visually monotonous.

HOW TO FIX — CONVERT 2-3 SCREENSHOT SCENES TO DIAGRAMS OR CHARTS:
Scenes about architecture, security, governance, orchestration, cost analysis, or any abstract concept
should use diagrams, NOT screenshots of the chat interface. Chat screenshots showing "Thinking..." all
look identical and tell the viewer nothing about the topic.

HOW TO CONVERT A SCREENSHOT SCENE TO A DIAGRAM:
1. Set visual_type to "diagram"
2. Set screenshot to null
3. Add a diagram_spec with D2 source code that illustrates the scene's key message
4. The diagram should show relationships, components, or data flow relevant to the topic

HOW TO CONVERT A SCREENSHOT SCENE TO A CHART:
1. Set visual_type to "chart"
2. Set screenshot to null
3. Add a diagram_spec with chart JSON spec (only if real data exists)
