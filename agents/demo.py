## Research Context
{research_context}

Available web interfaces for screenshots:

COCKPIT WEB (http://localhost:5173) — the custom dashboard:
- / — Main dashboard with action items (management nudges), agents grid, output pane. Sidebar: team health, daily briefing, goals tracking.
- /demos — Demo history browser with playback, download, and delete.

IMPORTANT: For screenshot specs, do NOT set wait_for — the pipeline automatically uses
known-good selectors for each route. Only set url and any actions needed.

Screenshot actions use SIMPLE syntax (NOT Playwright API):
- "scroll 1000" — scroll to middle content (agents grid, output pane)
- "scroll 2000" — scroll to lower content
- "scroll 3000" — scroll to bottom
- "click .selector" — click an element
- "type some text" — type text into focused element
- "wait 2000" — wait 2 seconds
IMPORTANT: The dashboard is tall — small scrolls (200-400px) won't show different content.
Use scroll values of 1000+ to see genuinely different dashboard panels.
Do NOT use page.evaluate(), page.locator(), or any Playwright API syntax — those will be ignored.

Generate a DemoScript with scenes that showcase the requested scope, tailored to this audience.
For each scene, choose the visual type using this decision framework:

STEP 1 — What is this scene communicating?
  A. A UI feature or live capability → screenshot (show the real system)
  B. Architecture, relationships, or component topology → diagram (D2)
  C. Quantitative data, trends, or comparisons → chart (only if real data exists in Research Context)
  D. Dynamic behavior that static images can't capture → screencast (max 2 per demo)
  E. A workflow or process sequence → diagram (D2), using the System Workflows section from Research Context for accurate step sequences
  F. An abstract concept, motivation, or "why" that has no concrete relationships to diagram → illustration (AI-generated conceptual image, max 3 per demo)

STEP 2 — Audience calibration:
  - Family/non-technical: simplify diagrams (3-5 nodes max), use simple chart types (bar only), skip architecture diagrams unless essential. Use illustration for abstract/motivational scenes.
  - Technical peer: full detail diagrams, complex charts ok, show design rationale
  - Leadership: high-level diagrams, KPI charts, focus on impact
  - Team member: operational diagrams, show the cadence and automation

STEP 3 — Coherence check:
  Does this visual DIRECTLY illustrate the scene's key message? If not, switch to a different type or use a clean title-card slide. A decorative visual is worse than no visual.

ANTI-PATTERNS — MUST AVOID:
  1. NEVER have 3+ consecutive scenes with the same visual_type. Alternate: screenshot, diagram, screenshot,
     chart, etc. Plan the visual type sequence BEFORE writing scenes. Example good sequence:
     screenshot, diagram, screenshot, chart, screenshot, diagram, chart, screenshot, diagram, ...
  2. Maximum 3 screenshots of /. Maximum 2 screenshots of /demos.
  3. Use diagrams for relationships/architecture, charts for data, screenshots only for showing REAL UI features.

Visual types:
- 'screenshot' — ONLY use localhost:5173 with paths: /, /demos
- 'diagram' — for architecture/relationships (include D2 source in diagram_spec)
- 'chart' — for data trends/comparisons (include chart spec JSON in diagram_spec)
- 'screencast' — for showing LIVE interactions (dashboard scrolling, agent execution)
- 'illustration' — for abstract concepts, motivation, personal meaning. NOT for architecture, data, or workflows.
  * Include an illustration spec with a descriptive prompt of what to visualize
  * The pipeline adds audience-appropriate style automatically
  * Max 3 illustration scenes per demo
  * No text will appear in the image — all text goes in key_points

SCREENCAST RULES:
- Use screencast when showing dynamic behavior that a static screenshot can't capture
- Maximum 2 screencast scenes per demo (expensive to record)
- You MUST use a named recipe — do NOT write custom interaction steps (they will be ignored)
- Set interaction with recipe name and url only. Example: interaction=InteractionSpec(url="http://localhost:5173/", recipe="dashboard-overview")

Available recipes and what they show on screen:
- 'dashboard-overview' — scrolls through the main dashboard panels on /
- 'run-system-check' — clicks system-check agent on dashboard, waits for output

CRITICAL: Your narration MUST match what the recipe actually shows on screen. If you use 'dashboard-overview', narrate about the dashboard panels — do NOT narrate about something else. The viewer will see dashboard content that contradicts the narration.

D2 diagram syntax rules (CRITICAL — invalid syntax causes render failures):
- Valid shapes: rectangle, square, circle, oval, diamond, cylinder, cloud, person, page, hexagon, package, queue, step, callout, stored_data, document, parallelogram, text, code
- INVALID shapes that will FAIL: eye, mic, phone, server, gear, bell, arrows, star, shield, lock, globe, box, terminal
- Do NOT add inline style.fill or style.stroke — the Gruvbox theme is applied automatically
- Keep diagrams simple: 3-7 nodes with labeled connections
- CORRECT shape syntax — shape goes INSIDE braces with 'shape:' property:
  'LiteLLM: {{\n  shape: rectangle\n}}\n\nOllama: {{\n  shape: cylinder\n}}\n\nLiteLLM -> Ollama: routes models'
- WRONG (DO NOT DO THIS): 'LiteLLM: rectangle' — this creates a child node named "rectangle", NOT a shape
- WRONG: 'Node: rectangle {{content}}' — "rectangle" becomes a child, not a shape
- For labels different from the node ID: 'MyNode: {{\n  label: "Display Name"\n  shape: cloud\n}}'
- For sublabels: 'MyNode: {{\n  label: "LiteLLM Gateway"\n  shape: rectangle\n  near: "127.0.0.1:4000"\n}}'

DIAGRAM VARIETY — each diagram must look visually DISTINCT from the others:
- Vary direction: use 'direction: right' for architectures, 'direction: down' for flows/pipelines, omit direction for clusters
- Use semantic shapes: cylinder for databases/storage, cloud for external services, person for actors/users, hexagon for central hubs, diamond for decisions, queue for buffers, document for files/reports
- Do NOT make every diagram a left-to-right chain of rectangles — that looks repetitive
- Each diagram should use a DIFFERENT dominant shape and layout pattern

IMPORTANT: Screenshot URLs MUST be http://localhost:5173/ or http://localhost:5173/demos. No other URLs exist.

Chart spec JSON format (use this exact structure, NOT Chart.js format):
  Bar: {{"type": "bar", "title": "Title", "data": {{"labels": ["A", "B"], "values": [10, 20]}}}}
  Horizontal bar: {{"type": "horizontal-bar", "title": "Title", "data": {{"labels": ["A", "B"], "values": [10, 20]}}}}
  Stacked bar: {{"type": "stacked-bar", "title": "Title", "data": {{"labels": ["A", "B"], "datasets": [{{"label": "Series 1", "data": [10, 20]}}, {{"label": "Series 2", "data": [5, 15]}}]}}}}
  Line: {{"type": "line", "title": "Title", "data": {{"x": [1, 2, 3], "y": [10, 20, 30]}}}}
  Area: {{"type": "area", "title": "Title", "data": {{"x": [1, 2, 3], "y": [10, 20, 30]}}, "xlabel": "Time", "ylabel": "Count"}}
  Pie: {{"type": "pie", "title": "Title", "data": {{"labels": ["A", "B", "C"], "values": [40, 35, 25]}}}}
  Gauge: {{"type": "gauge", "title": "Title", "data": {{"value": 74, "max": 75, "label": "Score"}}}}
  Network: {{"type": "network", "title": "Title", "data": {{"nodes": ["A", "B", "C"], "edges": [{{"source": "A", "target": "B"}}, {{"source": "B", "target": "C"}}]}}}}
  Multi-line: {{"type": "stacked-line", "title": "Title", "data": {{"labels": ["Day 1", "Day 2"], "datasets": [{{"label": "Series A", "data": [10, 20]}}, {{"label": "Series B", "data": [5, 15]}}]}}}}
  Timeline: {{"type": "timeline", "title": "Title", "data": {{"events": [{{"time": "07:00", "event": "Briefing"}}, {{"time": "12:00", "event": "Update"}}]}}}}

CHART DATA INTEGRITY (CRITICAL — violations cause automatic rejection):
- EVERY number in a chart MUST come verbatim from the Research Context. Do NOT invent illustrative data.
- If you don't have real data for a chart, use a DIAGRAM instead. Diagrams show relationships and architecture; charts show data. No data = no chart.
- Charts with placeholder/round numbers (10, 20, 30, 40) or suspiciously clean percentages (75%, 20%, 5%) are obvious fabrications and will be rejected.

ALLOWED CHART TYPES (use ONLY these — any other type will fail to render):
  bar, horizontal-bar, stacked-bar, line, area, pie, gauge, network, stacked-line, timeline
Do NOT invent chart types. "combined", "dashboard", "hierarchical", "heatmap", "treemap" etc. do NOT exist.

CHART TYPE SELECTION — match the chart to the data:
- Comparisons between categories → bar or horizontal-bar
- Proportions/composition → pie
- Trends over time → line, area, or stacked-line
- Single KPI/score → gauge
- Relationships/flow → network
- Event sequence → timeline
- Do NOT use the same chart type twice in a row

Each scene needs narration text, 2-4 key_points, and a visual type.
Tailor bullet complexity to the audience vocabulary level.
Write narration as natural spoken language — this will be read aloud by text-to-speech.

CRITICAL NARRATION STYLE RULE — visuals are STATIC images (screenshots, diagrams, charts), NOT live demos:
- NEVER write narration that references on-screen activity: "as you can see", "notice on screen", "if I click here", "watch as", "look at this data", "you'll see it updating"
- INSTEAD, narrate the concept, the design rationale, and personal experience: "The dashboard shows health status", "I built this to track...", "The architecture uses..."
- The visual ILLUSTRATES the topic; the narration EXPLAINS the topic. They complement, not describe each other.

CRITICAL NARRATION LENGTH RULES — YOUR DEMO WILL BE REJECTED IF NARRATIONS ARE TOO SHORT:
- Total word count across ALL narrations (intro + scenes + outro) MUST be at least {int(target_seconds * 2.5 * 0.65)} words. Target: {int(target_seconds * 2.5)} words.
- Each scene narration: MINIMUM {duration_constraints["words_per_scene"][0] if duration_constraints else 100} words, aim for {duration_constraints["words_per_scene"][1] if duration_constraints else 200} words.
- Intro narration: 15-30 words MAXIMUM (1-2 sentences). Plays over static title card — keep brief.
- Outro narration: 15-30 words MAXIMUM (1-2 sentences).
- Speech rate: 150 words/minute (2.5 words/second). Short narration = demo plays too fast.
- Write full paragraphs (5-8 sentences per scene) with concrete details from the research context.
- For 10+ minute demos: each scene is a mini-explanation (what it is → how it works → why it matters). Use REAL data only.
- COUNT YOUR WORDS. If a narration feels like 2-3 sentences, it's too short. Each scene needs a full spoken paragraph.

VISUAL-NARRATION ALIGNMENT (CRITICAL — misaligned scenes fail evaluation):
- Each scene's visual MUST directly illustrate the narration topic. Plan the visual FIRST, then write narration about what the visual shows.
- Screenshot of / (dashboard) → narrate health monitoring, system overview, or operational metrics
- Screenshot of /demos → narrate the demo system itself
- Diagram → narrate the architecture, flow, or relationships shown IN the diagram
- Chart → narrate the data, trends, or comparisons shown IN the chart
- Self-check: "If I mute the narration and show only the image, does the topic remain clear?"
- WRONG: narration about "automated scheduling" paired with a generic dashboard screenshot
- RIGHT: narration about "automated scheduling" paired with a diagram showing the agent→output→notification flow

VISUAL VARIETY RULES (CRITICAL — violations cause evaluation failure):
- PREFER screenshots and screencasts over diagrams. The audience wants to SEE the real system, not abstract diagrams.
- STRICT RATIO: At least 50% of scenes MUST be screenshots or screencasts. Count your scenes: if you have N scenes, at least ceil(N/2) must be screenshots or screencasts. For 18 scenes, that means 9+ screenshots/screencasts and at most 9 diagrams. VIOLATION OF THIS RATIO WILL FAIL EVALUATION.
- MAXIMUM 2 screencast scenes per demo (expensive to record).
- MANDATORY screenshot allocation:
  * At least 1 screenshot of http://localhost:5173/ (dashboard top — no scroll)
  * At least 1 screenshot of http://localhost:5173/ with "scroll 1000" (dashboard middle/bottom panels)
  * At least 1 screenshot of http://localhost:5173/demos (the demo listing — different page!)
  * Maximum 3 screenshots of / (use scroll variations: no scroll, scroll 1000, scroll 2000 for different panels)
  * Maximum 2 screenshots of /demos
- Use diagrams, charts, and illustrations for additional visual variety beyond the 2 available routes.
- NEVER use the same visual type 3+ times in a row. Always alternate diagram→screenshot or screenshot→diagram. After 2 consecutive diagrams, the NEXT scene MUST be a screenshot or screencast.
- When choosing between a diagram and a screenshot for any scene, DEFAULT TO SCREENSHOT unless the topic genuinely cannot be illustrated by any existing web page (e.g. showing a data flow that has no UI representation).
- Do NOT invent screenshot URLs. Only these 2 routes exist: http://localhost:5173/, http://localhost:5173/demos
- Charts must use ONLY real data from the Research Context. If you don't have real numbers, use a screenshot or diagram instead.

HONESTY AND ACCURACY RULES (violations cause automatic rejection):
- NEVER invent statistics, percentages, cost figures, or time-savings claims. Only cite numbers that appear verbatim in the Research Context below.
- This system is UNDER ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT. Do not narrate as if it's been running in daily life for months. Use "it's designed to...", "so far it can...".
- NEVER claim reliability like "hasn't given me trouble" or "runs smoothly" — the system is actively being developed and debugged.
- Do NOT describe generic LLM capabilities (answering questions, writing emails, summarizing) as unique to this system.
- CLEARLY DISTINGUISH what LLMs already do (chat, answer questions, summarize text) from what THIS SYSTEM adds on top (agents that run autonomously, self-monitoring, management profile learning across 6 dimensions, management support tools, decision preparation). This boundary is critical for non-technical audiences to understand what the builder actually created.
- The primary value is: management decision support, team awareness, pattern recognition, proactive nudges, and reduced cognitive load.

NARRATIVE STRUCTURE RULES:
- Scene 1 MUST be a big-picture overview: what this whole thing is, in plain terms, before ANY features. Use a screenshot of the dashboard (/) to show it's real, but the narration explains the overall concept.
- Scene 2-3 MUST include ONE overall system diagram showing the major pieces (agents, briefings, nudges, team health) and how they connect. This gives the viewer a mental map before diving into details.
- After scenes 1-3, each scene goes deeper into one specific capability.
- Do NOT lead with technical infrastructure (health monitoring, self-healing). Lead with what it DOES for the person — understanding people, achieving goals, management preparation.
- System health checks are background plumbing. Mention once briefly in ONE sentence, not as a featured scene or key point.
- The narration for dashboard screenshots should focus on what the FEATURES do for the user, not describe the UI layout.
- The Research Context includes a "Major System Components" section listing components that MUST appear in any full-system demo. Each component listed there needs at least a mention in narration, and the most important ones deserve their own scene.
- SELF-DEMO CAPABILITY IS MANDATORY: If the Major System Components section mentions a "Self-Demo System", you MUST dedicate at least one scene to it. This is a unique, differentiating capability — the system generates demos OF ITSELF. Use a screenshot of http://localhost:5173/demos to show the demo listing page, and narrate how the pipeline works (content planning, screenshots, voice cloning, evaluation loop). This scene is NON-NEGOTIABLE for any full-system demo.
- For concepts without a web UI, use a DIAGRAM to show data flows since Playwright can only screenshot web services.

TONE RULES (violations cause automatic rejection):
- This is NOT a pitch, NOT a presentation, NOT a story about the builder. Describe the software directly.
- Do NOT narrate the act of showing: "this is what I built", "let me show you", "what I've been working on", "here's my...". Just describe the system.
- No metaphors about workshops, garages, or labs. This is software. Describe it as software.
- Do NOT frame every feature around "this helps me with X" — describe what the feature DOES and HOW it works. Let the audience draw their own conclusions about value.
- Narrate like an engineer explaining software: matter-of-fact, specific, honest about what works and what doesn't yet.

VISUAL SUBSTANCE RULES (violations cause automatic rejection):
- Every visual MUST convey specific, meaningful information about THIS system. No decorative or generic illustrations.
- Diagrams must show REAL architecture from the Research Context: actual service names, actual data flows, actual agent names. No generic "Data Source → Processor → Output" diagrams.
- Charts must use REAL numbers from the Research Context. If the research says 76 health checks or 8 agents, use those exact numbers. No round-number placeholders.
- Each diagram should have a distinct topology: not everything is a left-to-right flow. Use clusters, hierarchies, cycles, hub-and-spoke patterns based on what the architecture actually looks like.
- If you can't make a visual that conveys real, specific information about this system, use a screenshot instead."""

Scene 1 should orient the viewer — show what the system DOES (not how it's built). Lead with a demo
of the most impressive or relatable capability, not an architecture diagram.

## Research Context
{research_context}

## Visual Rules

The logos web dashboard is at http://localhost:5173 with these pages:
- / — Main dashboard with action items (management nudges), agents grid, output pane. Sidebar: team health, daily briefing, goals tracking.
- /demos — Demo listing page

For screenshot specs, do NOT set wait_for — the pipeline handles selectors automatically.
Screenshot actions use SIMPLE syntax: "scroll 1000", "scroll 2000", "click .selector", "wait 2000".
Do NOT use page.evaluate(), page.locator(), or Playwright API — those are ignored. Use scroll values of 1000+ to show different dashboard panels.

Visual types:
- 'screenshot' — actual UI (ONLY localhost:5173 paths: /, /demos). Can screenshot same route at different scroll positions using actions=["scroll 1000"].
- 'diagram' — architecture/relationships. Include D2 source in diagram_spec.
- 'chart' — data trends/comparisons. You MUST include the chart spec JSON in diagram_spec.

CRITICAL: Every chart scene MUST have a complete JSON object in diagram_spec. An empty diagram_spec for a chart scene will crash the renderer. Example: diagram_spec='{{"type": "bar", "title": "Health Checks", "data": {{"labels": ["Pass", "Fail"], "values": [75, 3]}}}}'

D2 syntax: valid shapes are rectangle, square, circle, oval, diamond, cylinder, cloud, person, page, hexagon, package, queue, step, callout, stored_data, document, parallelogram, text, code. No inline styles.

Chart spec JSON format:
  Bar: {{"type": "bar", "title": "Title", "data": {{"labels": ["A", "B"], "values": [10, 20]}}}}
  Horizontal bar: {{"type": "horizontal-bar", "title": "Title", "data": {{"labels": ["A", "B"], "values": [10, 20]}}}}
  Stacked bar: {{"type": "stacked-bar", "title": "Title", "data": {{"labels": ["A", "B"], "datasets": [{{"label": "Series 1", "data": [10, 20]}}, {{"label": "Series 2", "data": [5, 15]}}]}}}}
  Line: {{"type": "line", "title": "Title", "data": {{"x": [1, 2, 3], "y": [10, 20, 30]}}}}
  Area: {{"type": "area", "title": "Title", "data": {{"x": [1, 2, 3], "y": [10, 20, 30]}}, "xlabel": "X", "ylabel": "Y"}}
  Pie: {{"type": "pie", "title": "Title", "data": {{"labels": ["A", "B", "C"], "values": [40, 35, 25]}}}}
  Gauge: {{"type": "gauge", "title": "Title", "data": {{"value": 74, "max": 75, "label": "Score"}}}}
  Network: {{"type": "network", "title": "Title", "data": {{"nodes": ["A", "B", "C"], "edges": [{{"source": "A", "target": "B"}}, {{"source": "B", "target": "C"}}]}}}}
  Multi-line: {{"type": "stacked-line", "title": "Title", "data": {{"labels": ["Day 1", "Day 2"], "datasets": [{{"label": "Series A", "data": [10, 20]}}, {{"label": "Series B", "data": [5, 15]}}]}}}}
  Timeline: {{"type": "timeline", "title": "Title", "data": {{"events": [{{"time": "07:00", "event": "Briefing"}}, {{"time": "12:00", "event": "Update"}}]}}}}

ALLOWED CHART TYPES (use ONLY these — any other type will fail to render):
  bar, horizontal-bar, stacked-bar, line, area, pie, gauge, network, stacked-line, timeline
Do NOT invent chart types like "combined", "dashboard", "hierarchical", "heatmap", "treemap" — these will crash.

CRITICAL — chart data integrity: EVERY number in a chart must come verbatim from the Research Context. No invented data. If no real data exists for a chart, use a DIAGRAM instead.
Common chart violations that WILL FAIL review:
- Fabricated percentages/ratios ("40% local, 60% cloud") — if the research doesn't have those exact numbers, use a diagram
- All-ones charts (every value = 1) — this is just a bulleted list rendered as a useless chart. Use a DIAGRAM with labeled nodes instead
- Fabricated gauge values — only use gauge if you have an exact count from research (e.g. "77/78 healthy")
- Invented pie chart splits — if you don't know the real proportions, use a diagram showing the relationship instead
RULE: If your chart would have all identical values OR any invented number, switch to visual_type "diagram" with D2 source code.

CRITICAL — chart types: ONLY use these types: bar, horizontal-bar, stacked-bar, line, area, pie, gauge, network, stacked-line, timeline. Do NOT invent types like "doughnut", "comparison", "combined", "dashboard", "hierarchical" — these will crash.

Diagram variety: vary direction (right, down, omit), use semantic shapes, each diagram must look visually distinct.

Visual variety: AT LEAST HALF of all scenes MUST be screenshots or screencasts. Default to screenshots — only use diagrams when no web page illustrates the concept. MANDATORY: at least one screenshot of each route (/, /demos). MAX 3 screenshots of / (use scroll positions for variety). MAX 2 screenshots of /demos. Use diagrams, charts, and illustrations for remaining visual variety. Max 2 screencasts. Max 3 illustrations. NEVER 3 consecutive same visual type. For WORKFLOW scenes, reference the System Workflows section for accurate step sequences — do NOT invent workflow topologies. Illustrations are for abstract concepts only — never for architecture, data, or workflows.

## Family Audience Scene Planning (applies when audience is family)
- Frame EVERY scene through personal impact: "this helps me because...", "the reason this matters is..."
- AVOID pure architecture scenes (e.g. "Three-Tier Agent Architecture") — family viewers don't care about tiers
- Instead of "how it's built", show "what it does for me" — reframe technical concepts through daily life
- Use scene titles that a non-technical person would find interesting, not conference-talk abstracts
- Chart data MUST come from research context — if no real numbers exist for a concept, use a diagram instead

## Slide Content Structure
Slides show key_points as bullet lists next to the visual. Good presentations use structured content:
- Aim for 3-6 key_points per scene (not 2-3). Each bullet should be a specific, concrete claim.
- For scenes that compare/contrast two approaches (e.g. "generic AI vs my system"), plan facts suitable for a comparison table rather than standalone bullets. The voice pass will render these as a slide_table.
- Keep bullet text short (8-15 words) — the narration provides the detail, bullets reinforce the takeaway.

## Honesty Rules
- Only cite numbers that appear verbatim in the Research Context.
- System is under active development — use "designed to", "so far it can".
- Focus on what's architecturally unique, not generic LLM capabilities.
- Only describe management capabilities that are visible in the Research Context.
- Do NOT plan content about capabilities that aren't in the Research Context. If the research doesn't mention it, the system doesn't do it.
- Do NOT plan facts that reference daily routines, habits, or specific times of day unless they appear in the Research Context (e.g. "timer fires at 07:00" is factual; "every morning I check..." is fabricated).

## Title Rules
- For family/non-technical audiences: use a conversational, personal title (e.g. "What I've Been Building", "My Management AI"). Avoid clinical or technical titles like "Management Decision Infrastructure" or "LLM Agent Platform".
- For technical audiences: descriptive titles are fine (e.g. "Three-Tier Agent Architecture", "Self-Healing LLM Stack").
- The title appears on the title card — it should look natural, not like a conference talk abstract.

## Output Instructions
Output a ContentSkeleton with:
- title and audience
- intro_points: 2-3 key points for the opening
- scenes: each with title, facts (specific claims grounded in research), data_citations (exact numbers), visual_type, visual_brief, screenshot/diagram_spec/interaction as needed, and optionally design_rationale and limitation_or_tradeoff
- outro_points: 2-3 key points for the closing

Do NOT write narration prose. Only output structured facts and visual plans."""

    result = f"""Transform this content skeleton into a complete DemoScript with spoken narration.

## ANTI-FABRICATION — READ THIS FIRST (violations are the #1 reason demos fail)
Fabricated content sounds immediately fake and destroys credibility. This is the most common failure mode.

FORBIDDEN PATTERNS — if you write ANY of these, the demo WILL be rejected:
- "Yesterday the system..." / "Last week it..." / "Last Tuesday..." / "This morning..." / "For example, yesterday..." — ALL temporal references to events that supposedly happened
- "For instance, last week when the knowledge search started returning empty results..." — fabricated troubleshooting story
- "it reminded me that Sarah mentioned..." — fabricated people and events
- "three client emails need responses" — fabricated specific counts
- "Claude cost forty-three dollars" — fabricated dollar amounts
- "disk cleanup freed up eight gigabytes" — fabricated metrics
- "eighty-five percent capacity" — fabricated percentages not in research context
- Any sentence describing a SPECIFIC EVENT that happened at a specific time

ALLOWED PATTERNS — use ONLY these:
- Present tense capability: "The system runs health checks every 15 minutes" (if 15 minutes is in research context)
- General capability: "When something breaks, it tries to fix it automatically"
- Hypothetical/conditional: "If a service crashes overnight, I get a notification"
- Exact data from research context: quote exact numbers that appear in the provided research

SELF-CHECK REQUIREMENT: Before finalizing, scan EVERY sentence for temporal markers (yesterday, last week, this morning, last Tuesday, recently, the other day, for example/instance + past tense). If found, rewrite as present-tense capability or hypothetical.

## Content Skeleton (WHAT to say)
{skeleton_json}

## Voice Examples (HOW to say it)
Match the voice of these examples. Every narration passage you write should sound like it was written by the same person.
{examples_text}
{bad_example_text}

## Voice Profile
{profile_text}

## Word Count Targets (MUST HIT THESE — scripts that are too short WILL FAIL)
- Target per scene: {(words_min + words_max) // 2} words ({words_min} minimum, {words_max} maximum).
- Total target: ~{total_words} words across all narrations = {target_seconds}s at 150 wpm.
- With {len(skeleton.scenes)} scenes + intro + outro, each scene needs ~{total_words // (len(skeleton.scenes) + 2)} words.
- Each scene should have 4-6 sentences, each developing ONE specific point from the skeleton's facts.
- Intro narration: 15-30 words MAXIMUM (1-2 sentences). Plays over a static title card. MUST say what this is — "I built a personal AI system that..." NOT vague framing like "I've been working on something." For family audiences, keep it warm and personal — NO jargon like "infrastructure" or "externalized executive function".
- Outro narration: 15-30 words MAXIMUM (1-2 sentences). A simple closing. Match the intro's register.
- PACING: Each scene = one focused idea with one visual. The viewer should never wonder "why am I still looking at this same image?" If you're making 5+ points in one scene, the scene is too long.

## Title
- For family/non-technical audiences: use a short, conversational title (e.g. "What I've Been Building"). NOT clinical terms like "Executive Function Infrastructure".
- Keep the title under 6 words. It appears on a title card.

## Visual-Narration Alignment (CRITICAL)
For each scene, the narration MUST describe what is visible in the visual:
- If the visual is a screenshot of the dashboard → narrate what the dashboard shows
- If the visual is a diagram of agent architecture → narrate the architecture shown in the diagram
- If the visual is a chart of health scores → narrate the data shown in the chart
- If the visual is a screencast → narrate what happens in real time ("the system streams its response...", "watch as the health check runs...")
- Do NOT narrate features or concepts that are not represented in the scene's visual
- Do NOT show a visual that illustrates something different from what the narration describes
- Self-check each scene: "If I mute the audio and show only the image, does the topic remain clear?"
- For screencast scenes: narration should be timed to describe what the viewer sees happening in the recording

## Personal Connection (family/non-technical audiences)
For family audiences, every scene should answer "why does this matter to the operator's daily life?"
- Don't just describe WHAT the system does — explain WHY it helps or what changes because of it
- Connect technical capabilities to human outcomes: less stress, better preparation, fewer things forgotten
- Use the profile facts to ground narration in real details about how the operator works, thinks, and lives
- The viewer should feel like they understand the person better after watching, not just the technology
- Technical architecture scenes (tiers, data flow) should be reframed through personal impact

## Instructions
1. Use the skeleton's facts and data_citations as raw material for each scene's narration
2. Write narration in the voice demonstrated by the examples above
3. Include design_rationale and limitation_or_tradeoff from the skeleton where provided
4. Preserve the skeleton's visual_type, screenshot specs, diagram_spec, and interaction specs exactly
5. Generate 3-6 key_points per scene (concrete, specific bullets — these appear as bullet lists on the slide)
6. Set duration_hint based on word count / 2.5
7. Narration describes concepts and how things work — visuals are static images, not live demos
8. Each scene's narration must match its visual (see Visual-Narration Alignment above)
9. For comparison/contrast scenes (e.g. "generic AI vs personal system"), use slide_table instead of key_points — provide a list of rows where the first row is the header

Return a complete DemoScript with title, audience (set to the archetype name like 'family' or 'technical-peer', NOT a description), intro_narration, scenes, and outro_narration."""
