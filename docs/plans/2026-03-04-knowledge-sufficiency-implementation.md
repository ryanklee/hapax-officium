# Knowledge Sufficiency Engine — Implementation Plan

> **For Claude:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task.

**Goal:** Build a system that detects missing management knowledge in the Obsidian vault and acquires it through guided interviews.

**Architecture:** A YAML knowledge model (hapaxromana) defines 27 requirements across 3 tiers. A deterministic Python audit (ai-agents) scans the vault and produces a prioritized gap list, feeding nudges. An Obsidian plugin interview engine (obsidian-hapax) conducts guided conversations to populate missing data, writing vault notes via the Obsidian API.

**Tech Stack:** Python 3.12 (pydantic, pyyaml, pytest), TypeScript (Obsidian API, esbuild), YAML

**Repos:** `~/projects/hapaxromana/`, `~/projects/ai-agents/ `, `~/projects/obsidian-hapax/`

**Design doc:** `docs/plans/2026-03-04-knowledge-sufficiency-design.md`

---

## Task 1: Create Knowledge Model YAML

**Repo:** `~/projects/hapaxromana/`

**Files:**
- Create: `knowledge/management-sufficiency.yaml`

**Step 1: Create the knowledge directory**

```bash
mkdir -p ~/projects/hapaxromana/knowledge
```

**Step 2: Write the knowledge model**

Create `~/projects/hapaxromana/knowledge/management-sufficiency.yaml` with all 27 requirements. Each entry has: `id`, `category`, `description`, `source`, `check` (type + params), `acquisition` (method, question, extraction_schema, output), `priority`, `depends_on`.

```yaml
# Knowledge Sufficiency Model
# Defines what the management system needs to know to function.
# Categories: foundational (system non-functional without), structural (features degrade), enrichment (quality improves)
# Sources: TT = Team Topologies, SP = Scaling People, EP = An Elegant Puzzle
version: 1

## Task 3: Sufficiency Audit — Orchestrator (TDD)

**Repo:** `~/projects/ai-agents/ `

**Files:**
- Modify: `logos/data/knowledge_sufficiency.py`

uv run pytest tests/test_knowledge_sufficiency.py::TestSufficiencyNudges -v
```

Expected: FAIL — `ImportError: cannot import name 'gaps_to_nudges'`

**Step 3: Add `gaps_to_nudges` to `logos/data/knowledge_sufficiency.py`**

Append to the file:

```python
# ── Nudge generation ─────────────────────────────────────────────

def gaps_to_nudges(gaps: list[KnowledgeGap]) -> list["Nudge"]:
    """Convert unsatisfied knowledge gaps to nudges.

    from cockpit.data.nudges import Nudge

    nudges: list[Nudge] = []

    for gap in gaps:
        if gap.satisfied:
            continue

        # Skip if any dependency is unsatisfied
        if any(dep not in satisfied_ids for dep in gap.depends_on):
            continue

        label = (
            "high" if gap.category == "foundational"
            else "medium" if gap.category == "structural"

        else:
            action = f"Create: {gap.description.strip()}"
            hint = ""

        nudges.append(Nudge(
            category="knowledge",
            priority_score=gap.priority,
            priority_label=label,
            title=f"Missing: {gap.description.strip()[:80]}",
            detail=gap.description.strip(),
            suggested_action=action,
            command_hint=hint,
            source_id=f"knowledge:{gap.requirement_id}",
        ))

    return nudges
```

**Step 4: Modify `logos/data/nudges.py` to integrate the new collector**

In `nudges.py`, add the new collector function after `_collect_sufficiency_nudges` (after line 498):

```python
def _collect_knowledge_sufficiency_nudges(nudges: list[Nudge]) -> None:
    """Generate nudges from knowledge sufficiency gaps."""
    try:
        from cockpit.data.knowledge_sufficiency import collect_knowledge_gaps, gaps_to_nudges
        report = collect_knowledge_gaps()
        nudges.extend(gaps_to_nudges(report.gaps))
    except Exception:
        pass
```

In `collect_nudges()`, add the call after `_collect_sufficiency_nudges(nudges)` (after line 575):

```python
    _collect_knowledge_sufficiency_nudges(nudges)
```

Update the Nudge docstring category list (line 29) to include `"knowledge"`:

```python
    category: str        # "health" | "briefing" | "readiness" | "profile" | "scout" | "drift" | "action" | "knowledge"
```

**Step 5: Run tests to verify they pass**

```bash
cd ~/projects/ai-agents
uv run pytest tests/test_knowledge_sufficiency.py -v
```

Expected: All 27 tests PASS.

**Step 6: Run full test suite**

```bash
cd ~/projects/ai-agents
uv run pytest --tb=short -q
```

Expected: All existing tests still pass (no regressions). The new knowledge sufficiency collector is wrapped in try/except so it won't break if YAML file is missing.

**Step 7: Commit**

```bash
cd ~/projects/ai-agents
git add logos/data/knowledge_sufficiency.py logos/data/nudges.py tests/test_knowledge_sufficiency.py
git commit -m "feat(sufficiency): knowledge gap nudge integration — priority-ordered, dependency-aware

Adds gaps_to_nudges() that converts unsatisfied knowledge gaps to
nudges. Skips gaps blocked by unsatisfied dependencies. Integrates
with nudge collector as 'knowledge' category. Foundational=high,
structural=medium, enrichment=low."
```

## Task 5: Interview Question Templates (Obsidian Plugin)

**Repo:** `~/projects/obsidian-hapax/`

**Files:**
- Create: `src/interview/knowledge-model.ts`
- Create: `src/interview/questions.ts`

No test framework in this repo — verify via `pnpm run build`.

**Step 1: Create the interview directory**

```bash
mkdir -p ~/projects/obsidian-hapax/src/interview
```

**Step 2: Create the knowledge model TypeScript module**

Create `src/interview/knowledge-model.ts`. This is the bundled version of the YAML model — the plugin cannot read YAML at runtime. Contains the same requirements but typed.

```typescript
/**
 * Knowledge model — bundled version of hapaxromana/knowledge/management-sufficiency.yaml.
 *
 * This is the single source of interview questions and requirement metadata
 * for the plugin. When the YAML model changes, this file must be updated.

## Task 9: Chat Integration — /setup Commands + Banner

**Repo:** `~/projects/obsidian-hapax/`

**Files:**
- Modify: `src/slash-commands.ts`
- Modify: `src/chat-view.ts`
- Modify: `src/main.ts`

**Step 1: Add /setup commands to slash-commands.ts**

In `src/slash-commands.ts`, add 3 new entries to the `COMMANDS` array (after `/team-risks`):

```typescript
  {
    name: "/setup",
    description: "Start or resume management data setup interview",
    template: "__SETUP_START__",
  },
  {
    name: "/setup skip",
    description: "Skip the current setup question",
    template: "__SETUP_SKIP__",
  },
  {
    name: "/setup status",
    description: "Show setup progress",
    template: "__SETUP_STATUS__",
  },
```

These use sentinel template values that `chat-view.ts` will intercept.

**Step 2: Add interview engine to chat-view.ts**

At the top of `src/chat-view.ts`, add the import (after line 10):

```typescript
import { InterviewEngine, type InterviewProgress } from "./interview/engine";
```

Add a new property to the `ChatView` class (after line 23):

```typescript
  private interviewEngine: InterviewEngine | null = null;
```

In the `onOpen()` method (find it in the file — it creates the chat container), add interview engine initialization after the existing setup:

```typescript
    // Initialize interview engine
    this.interviewEngine = new InterviewEngine(
      this.app,
      this.plugin.settings,
      () => this.plugin.loadData() as Promise<Record<string, unknown>>,
      (data) => this.plugin.saveData(data),
    );
    await this.interviewEngine.load();

    // Show setup banner if foundational gaps exist
    if (this.interviewEngine.hasFoundationalGaps()) {
      this.showSetupBanner();
    }
```

Add new methods to the `ChatView` class:

```typescript
  // ── Interview UI ────────────────────────────────────────────

  private showSetupBanner(): void {
    const existing = this.containerEl.querySelector(".hapax-setup-banner");
    if (existing) return;

    const banner = document.createElement("div");
    banner.addClass("hapax-setup-banner");

    const text = document.createElement("span");
    text.setText("Your management system needs setup data");
    banner.appendChild(text);

    const btn = document.createElement("button");
    btn.setText("Start Setup");
    btn.addClass("hapax-setup-btn");
    btn.addEventListener("click", () => this.handleSetupStart());
    banner.appendChild(btn);

    // Insert after header, before messages
    const header = this.containerEl.querySelector(".hapax-chat-header");
    if (header?.nextSibling) {
      header.parentElement?.insertBefore(banner, header.nextSibling);
    } else {
      this.containerEl.prepend(banner);
    }
  }

  private removeSetupBanner(): void {
    const banner = this.containerEl.querySelector(".hapax-setup-banner");
    banner?.remove();
  }

  private async showSetupProgress(): Promise<void> {
    if (!this.interviewEngine) return;
    const progress = await this.interviewEngine.getProgress();
    const text = `**Setup Progress**\n` +
      `- Foundational: ${progress.foundational.done}/${progress.foundational.total}\n` +
      `- Structural: ${progress.structural.done}/${progress.structural.total}\n` +
      `- Enrichment: ${progress.enrichment.done}/${progress.enrichment.total}`;

    const statusMsg: ChatMessage = {
      role: "assistant",
      content: text,
      timestamp: Date.now(),
    };
    this.messages.push(statusMsg);
    this.renderMessage(statusMsg);
  }

  private async handleSetupStart(): Promise<void> {
    if (!this.interviewEngine) return;

    const q = await this.interviewEngine.start();
    if (!q) {
      const doneMsg: ChatMessage = {
        role: "assistant",
        content: "All interview-acquirable requirements are satisfied! Your management system is operational.",
        timestamp: Date.now(),
      };
      this.messages.push(doneMsg);
      this.renderMessage(doneMsg);
      this.removeSetupBanner();
      return;
    }

    await this.showSetupProgress();

    const questionMsg: ChatMessage = {
      role: "assistant",
      content: q.question,
      timestamp: Date.now(),
    };
    this.messages.push(questionMsg);
    this.renderMessage(questionMsg);
  }

  private async handleSetupSkip(): Promise<void> {
    if (!this.interviewEngine) return;

    const next = await this.interviewEngine.skip();
    if (next) {
      const msg: ChatMessage = {
        role: "assistant",
        content: `Skipped. Next question:\n\n${next.question}`,
        timestamp: Date.now(),
      };
      this.messages.push(msg);
      this.renderMessage(msg);
    } else {
      const msg: ChatMessage = {
        role: "assistant",
        content: "No more questions. Setup complete!",
        timestamp: Date.now(),
      };
      this.messages.push(msg);
      this.renderMessage(msg);
      this.removeSetupBanner();
    }
  }
```

In the `sendMessage()` method, add an intercept at the very beginning (before the existing message processing) to detect setup commands and interview-mode answers:

```typescript
    // Intercept setup commands
    if (text === "__SETUP_START__") {
      await this.handleSetupStart();
      return;
    }
    if (text === "__SETUP_SKIP__") {
      await this.handleSetupSkip();
      return;
    }
    if (text === "__SETUP_STATUS__") {
      await this.showSetupProgress();
      return;
    }

    // If interview is active, process answer through interview engine
    if (this.interviewEngine?.isActive()) {
      // Show user message
      const userMsg: ChatMessage = { role: "user", content: text, timestamp: Date.now() };
      this.messages.push(userMsg);
      this.renderMessage(userMsg);

      // Process through interview engine
      const result = await this.interviewEngine.processAnswer(text);

      const resultMsg: ChatMessage = {
        role: "assistant",
        content: result.message,
        timestamp: Date.now(),
      };
      this.messages.push(resultMsg);
      this.renderMessage(resultMsg);

      if (result.nextQuestion) {
        const nextMsg: ChatMessage = {
          role: "assistant",
          content: result.nextQuestion.question,
          timestamp: Date.now(),
        };
        this.messages.push(nextMsg);
        this.renderMessage(nextMsg);
      } else if (result.success) {
        const doneMsg: ChatMessage = {
          role: "assistant",
          content: "Setup interview complete! All acquirable requirements satisfied.",
          timestamp: Date.now(),
        };
        this.messages.push(doneMsg);
        this.renderMessage(doneMsg);

        // Check if foundational complete
        const progress = await this.interviewEngine.getProgress();
        if (progress.foundationalComplete) {
          this.removeSetupBanner();
          const opMsg: ChatMessage = {
            role: "assistant",
            content: "Management system is now operational. All foundational data is in place.",
            timestamp: Date.now(),
          };
          this.messages.push(opMsg);
          this.renderMessage(opMsg);
        }
      }

      this.scrollToBottom();
      await this.saveChatHistory();
      return;
    }
```

**Step 3: Verify build**

```bash
cd ~/projects/obsidian-hapax

```

Expected: Build succeeds.

**Step 4: Commit**

```bash
cd ~/projects/obsidian-hapax

## Task 10: Interview CSS Styles

**Repo:** `~/projects/obsidian-hapax/`

**Files:**
- Modify: `styles.css`

**Step 1: Append interview styles to `styles.css`**

Add at the end of `~/projects/obsidian-hapax/styles.css`:

```css
/* Interview setup banner */
.hapax-setup-banner {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: space-between;
  padding: 8px 12px;
  background: var(--background-secondary);
  border-bottom: 2px solid var(--interactive-accent);
  font-size: 13px;
  color: var(--text-normal);
}

.hapax-setup-btn {
  background: var(--interactive-accent);
  color: var(--text-on-accent);
  border: none;
  padding: 4px 12px;
  border-radius: 4px;
  cursor: pointer;
  font-size: 12px;
  font-weight: 600;
}

.hapax-setup-btn:hover {
  opacity: 0.9;
}
```

**Step 2: Verify build**

```bash
cd ~/projects/obsidian-hapax
pnpm run build
```

Expected: Build succeeds.

**Step 3: Commit**

```bash
cd ~/projects/obsidian-hapax
git add styles.css
git commit -m "feat(interview): setup banner CSS styles

Persistent banner with accent border and Start Setup button.
Uses Obsidian CSS custom properties for theme compatibility."
```

---

## Task 11: Final Build and Cross-Repo Verification

**Step 1: Build obsidian-hapax plugin**

```bash
cd ~/projects/obsidian-hapax
pnpm run build
```

Expected: Build succeeds with no errors.

**Step 2: Verify TypeScript compiles**

```bash
cd ~/projects/obsidian-hapax
npx -y tsc --noEmit
```

Expected: No type errors.

**Step 3: Run ai-agents full test suite**

```bash
cd ~/projects/ai-agents
uv run pytest --tb=short -q
```

Expected: All tests pass including the ~27 new knowledge sufficiency tests.

**Step 4: Validate YAML model**

```bash
cd ~/projects/hapaxromana
python3 -c "import yaml; d = yaml.safe_load(open('knowledge/management-sufficiency.yaml')); print(f'{len(d[\"requirements\"])} requirements loaded')"
```

Expected: `27 requirements loaded`

**Step 5: Verify QuickAdd config is still valid JSON**

```bash
python3 -c "import json; json.load(open('$HOME/Documents/Personal/.obsidian/plugins/quickadd/data.json'))"
```

Expected: No error.

**Step 6: Final commits**

If any files were missed, add and commit them. Then tag:

```bash
cd ~/projects/hapaxromana
git add -A
git status  # verify only expected files
# commit if needed

cd ~/projects/ai-agents
git add -A
git status
# commit if needed
```

## Post-Implementation Manual Steps

1. **Reload hapax plugin**: Obsidian → Settings → Community Plugins → toggle obsidian-hapax off/on
2. **Test /setup**: Open chat sidebar, type `/setup` → should show progress + first question
3. **Test banner**: If no person notes exist in `10-work/people/`, banner should appear
4. **Test extraction**: Answer the first question with team member names → verify person notes created
5. **Verify nudges**: Run `uv run logos --once` from `~/projects/ai-agents/ ` → should show knowledge gaps in nudges
