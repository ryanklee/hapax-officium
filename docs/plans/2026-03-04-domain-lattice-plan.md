# Domain Lattice Engine Implementation Plan

> **For Claude:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task.

**Goal:** Generalize the management-specific Knowledge Sufficiency Engine into a multi-domain awareness system with momentum tracking, emergence detection, adaptive sufficiency, and a logos dashboard.

**Architecture:** Domain registry YAML in hapaxromana defines domains, relationships, governance, and person extensions. Python audit engine in ai-agents loops over all domains. Cockpit dashboard shows per-domain health. Emergence detection clusters undomained activity into candidate domains. All zero-LLM except emergence proposals.

**Tech Stack:** Python 3.12, pytest, YAML, Textual 8.0.0, Pydantic, Rich. No new dependencies.

**Design doc:** `docs/plans/2026-03-04-domain-lattice-design.md`

## Phase 1: Domain Registry + Multi-Domain Audit

### Task 1: Create Domain Registry YAML

**Files:**
- Create: `~/projects/hapaxromana/domains/registry.yaml`

**Step 1: Create the directory and file**

```bash
mkdir -p ~/projects/hapaxromana/domains
```

Create `~/projects/hapaxromana/domains/registry.yaml`:

```yaml
# domains/registry.yaml — Life domain definitions for the Domain Lattice Engine.
# Schema: domains declare vault paths, profiler dimensions, relationships,
# governance, and person extensions. Constitutional layer constrains all domains.

### Task 3: Add Domain Registry Loader to knowledge_sufficiency.py

**Files:**
- Modify: `~/projects/logos/data/knowledge_sufficiency.py:17-23`
- Test: `~/projects/tests/test_knowledge_sufficiency.py`

**Step 1: Write the failing test**

Add to `~/projects/tests/test_knowledge_sufficiency.py`:

```python
from cockpit.data.knowledge_sufficiency import (
    DOMAIN_REGISTRY_PATH,
    load_domain_registry,
)


class TestDomainRegistry:
    def test_registry_path_exists(self) -> None:
        """Domain registry YAML file exists on disk."""
        assert DOMAIN_REGISTRY_PATH.is_file(), f"Missing: {DOMAIN_REGISTRY_PATH}"

    def test_load_registry_has_domains(self) -> None:
        """Registry loads and contains at least 4 domains."""
        registry = load_domain_registry()
        assert "domains" in registry
        assert len(registry["domains"]) >= 4

    def test_load_registry_has_constitutional(self) -> None:
        """Registry has a constitutional layer."""
        registry = load_domain_registry()
        assert "constitutional" in registry

    def test_management_domain_has_sufficiency_model(self) -> None:
        """Management domain references its sufficiency YAML."""
        registry = load_domain_registry()
        mgmt = next(d for d in registry["domains"] if d["id"] == "management")

            assert "governance" in domain, f"Missing governance in {domain['id']}"
```

**Step 2: Run test to verify it fails**

```bash
cd ~/projects/ai-agents
uv run pytest tests/test_knowledge_sufficiency.py::TestDomainRegistry -v
```

Expected: FAIL with `ImportError` — `DOMAIN_REGISTRY_PATH` and `load_domain_registry` don't exist yet.

**Step 3: Implement registry loader**

In `~/projects/logos/data/knowledge_sufficiency.py`, add after line 23 (after `KNOWLEDGE_MODEL_PATH`):

```python
DOMAIN_REGISTRY_PATH = (
    Path.home() / "projects" / "hapaxromana" / "domains" / "registry.yaml"
)

KNOWLEDGE_DIR = (
    Path.home() / "projects" / "hapaxromana" / "knowledge"
)
```

Add a new function after `load_knowledge_model()` (after line 202):

```python
def load_domain_registry(path: Path | None = None) -> dict:
    """Load the domain registry YAML from disk."""
    target = path or DOMAIN_REGISTRY_PATH
    with open(target, encoding="utf-8") as f:
        return yaml.safe_load(f)
```

**Step 4: Run test to verify it passes**

```bash
cd ~/projects/ai-agents
uv run pytest tests/test_knowledge_sufficiency.py::TestDomainRegistry -v
```

Expected: PASS (5 tests)

**Step 5: Commit**

```bash
cd ~/projects/ai-agents
git add logos/data/knowledge_sufficiency.py tests/test_knowledge_sufficiency.py
git commit -m "feat: domain registry loader — DOMAIN_REGISTRY_PATH, load_domain_registry()"
```

**Step 2: Run test to verify it fails**

```bash

Expected: FAIL — `gaps_to_nudges` doesn't accept `domain_id` parameter.

**Step 3: Implement domain_id parameter**

In `~/projects/logos/data/knowledge_sufficiency.py`, modify `gaps_to_nudges`:

Change the function signature from:
```python
def gaps_to_nudges(gaps: list[KnowledgeGap]) -> list["Nudge"]:
```
To:
```python
def gaps_to_nudges(gaps: list[KnowledgeGap], *, domain_id: str = "") -> list["Nudge"]:
```

Change the source_id line from:
```python
            source_id=f"knowledge:{gap.requirement_id}",
```
To:
```python
            source_id=f"knowledge:{domain_id}:{gap.requirement_id}" if domain_id else f"knowledge:{gap.requirement_id}",
```

**Step 4: Update _collect_knowledge_sufficiency_nudges**

In `~/projects/logos/data/nudges.py`, replace lines 501-508:

```python
def _collect_knowledge_sufficiency_nudges(nudges: list[Nudge]) -> None:
    """Generate nudges from knowledge sufficiency gaps across all domains."""
    try:
        from cockpit.data.knowledge_sufficiency import collect_all_domain_gaps, gaps_to_nudges

            nudges.extend(gaps_to_nudges(report.gaps, domain_id=domain_id))
    except Exception:
        pass
```

**Step 5: Run test to verify it passes**

```bash
cd ~/projects/ai-agents
uv run pytest tests/test_knowledge_sufficiency.py::TestDomainScopedNudges -v
```

Expected: PASS

**Step 6: Run full test suite**

```bash
cd ~/projects/ai-agents
uv run pytest tests/test_knowledge_sufficiency.py tests/test_nudges.py -v
```

Expected: All PASS

**Step 7: Commit**

```bash
cd ~/projects/ai-agents
git add logos/data/knowledge_sufficiency.py logos/data/nudges.py tests/test_knowledge_sufficiency.py
git commit -m "feat: domain-scoped nudges — gaps_to_nudges(domain_id=), multi-domain nudge collector"

## Phase 3: Universal Person Model

### Task 7: Update Person Template

**Files:**
- Modify: `data/50-templates/tpl-person.md`

**Step 1: Read current template**

```bash
cat data/50-templates/tpl-person.md
```

**Step 2: Add domains field to frontmatter**

Add `domains:` field after `status:` in the frontmatter section. Also add core universal fields `relationship:`, `first-met:`, `last-interaction:`.

Insert after the `status: active` line:

```yaml
domains: [management]
relationship: <% await tp.system.suggester(["direct-report", "manager", "stakeholder", "peer", "collaborator", "family", "friend"], ["direct-report", "manager", "stakeholder", "peer", "collaborator", "family", "friend"]) %>
first-met:
last-interaction:
```

**Step 3: Commit (vault is not git-tracked — just save)**

No git commit for vault changes. Obsidian Sync handles distribution.

### Task 8: Update PersonState to Read New Fields

**Files:**
- Modify: `~/projects/logos/data/management.py`
- Test: `~/projects/tests/test_management.py`

**Step 1: Write the failing test**

Add to `~/projects/tests/test_management.py`:

```python
class TestPersonStateDomains:
    def test_person_state_has_domains_field(self) -> None:
        """PersonState includes domains list."""
        from cockpit.data.management import PersonState

        import inspect
        fields = {f.name for f in __import__("dataclasses").fields(PersonState)}
        assert "relationship" in fields
```

**Step 2: Run test to verify it fails**

```bash
cd ~/projects/ai-agents
uv run pytest tests/test_management.py::TestPersonStateDomains -v
```

Expected: FAIL — `domains` field doesn't exist on PersonState.

**Step 3: Add fields to PersonState**

In `~/projects/logos/data/management.py`, add to the PersonState dataclass (after the existing fields):

```python
    # Universal person model fields
    domains: list[str] = field(default_factory=lambda: ["management"])
    relationship: str = ""
```

In `_collect_people()`, after reading existing frontmatter fields, add:

```python
        domains_raw = fm.get("domains", ["management"])
        if isinstance(domains_raw, str):
            domains = [d.strip() for d in domains_raw.split(",")]
        elif isinstance(domains_raw, list):
            domains = domains_raw
        else:
            domains = ["management"]
```

And pass `domains=domains, relationship=str(fm.get("relationship", ""))` to the PersonState constructor.

**Step 4: Run test to verify it passes**

```bash
cd ~/projects/ai-agents
uv run pytest tests/test_management.py::TestPersonStateDomains -v
```

Expected: PASS

**Step 5: Run full management tests**

```bash
cd ~/projects/ai-agents
uv run pytest tests/test_management.py -v
```

Expected: All PASS

**Step 6: Commit**

```bash
cd ~/projects/ai-agents
git add logos/data/management.py tests/test_management.py
git commit -m "feat: PersonState universal fields — domains list, relationship"
```

### Task 11: Create Domain Health Widget

**Files:**
- Create: `~/projects/cockpit/widgets/domain_health.py`

**Step 1: Implement the widget**

Create `~/projects/cockpit/widgets/domain_health.py`:

```python
"""DomainHealthWidget — per-domain sufficiency bars with momentum arrows."""
from __future__ import annotations

from rich.text import Text
from textual.widget import Widget
from textual.widgets import Static

from cockpit.data.domain_health import DomainHealthSnapshot, DomainStatus


DIRECTION_ARROWS = {
    "accelerating": "\u2191",   # ↑
    "steady": "\u2192",         # →
    "decelerating": "\u2193",   # ↓
    "dormant": "\u25cb",        # ○
}

BAR_WIDTH = 10


def _render_bar(score: float) -> str:
    """Render a proportional bar: ████░░░░░░"""
    filled = int(score * BAR_WIDTH)
    empty = BAR_WIDTH - filled
    return "\u2588" * filled + "\u2591" * empty


def render_domain_health(snapshot: DomainHealthSnapshot | None) -> Text:
    """Render domain health panel as Rich Text."""
    text = Text()

    if snapshot is None or not snapshot.domains:
        text.append("No domain data", style="dim")
        return text

    text.append("Domain Health\n", style="bold")
    text.append("")

    for d in snapshot.domains:
        if d.status not in ("active", "dormant"):
            continue

        arrow = DIRECTION_ARROWS.get(d.direction, "?")
        pct = int(d.sufficiency_score * 100)
        bar = _render_bar(d.sufficiency_score)

        # Color based on score
        if pct >= 70:
            color = "green"
        elif pct >= 40:
            color = "yellow"
        else:
            color = "red"

        name_padded = d.domain_id[:12].ljust(12)
        text.append(f"  {name_padded} ", style="dim" if d.status == "dormant" else "")
        text.append(bar, style=color)
        text.append(f" {pct:3d}%", style=color)
        text.append(f" {arrow}\n")

    if snapshot.emergence_candidate_count > 0:
        text.append(f"\n  \u26a1 {snapshot.emergence_candidate_count} emergence candidate(s)\n",
                     style="yellow")

    overall_pct = int(snapshot.overall_score * 100)
    text.append(f"\n  Overall: {overall_pct}%", style="bold")

    return text
```

**Step 2: Commit**

```bash
cd ~/projects/ai-agents
git add cockpit/widgets/domain_health.py
git commit -m "feat: domain health widget — per-domain bars with momentum arrows"
```

### Task 12: Integrate Domain Health into Sidebar

**Files:**
- Modify: `~/projects/cockpit/widgets/sidebar.py:57-63`
- Modify: `~/projects/cockpit/app.py:195-245`

**Step 1: Add domain health section to sidebar**

In `~/projects/cockpit/widgets/sidebar.py`, in the `compose()` method (line 57-63), add after the `goals` section:

```python
        yield SidebarSection("domain-health", id="sb-domain-health")
```

In `__init__`, add:

```python
        self._domain_health = None
```

Add a new method to SidebarStatus:

```python
    def update_domain_health(self, snapshot) -> None:
        """Update domain health section."""
        self._domain_health = snapshot
        from cockpit.widgets.domain_health import render_domain_health
        self.query_one("#sb-domain-health").update(render_domain_health(snapshot))
```

**Step 2: Call domain health collector in refresh_slow**

In `~/projects/cockpit/app.py`, in `refresh_slow()` (around line 195):

Add import at top of file:
```python
from cockpit.data.domain_health import collect_domain_health
```

In the `refresh_slow` method, after `goals = collect_goals()` (line 203), add:

```python
        domain_health = collect_domain_health()
```

After `sidebar.update_goals(goals)` (line 238), add:

```python
        sidebar.update_domain_health(domain_health)
```

**Step 3: Run cockpit to verify**

```bash
cd ~/projects/ai-agents
uv run logos --once 2>&1 | head -30
```

Expected: No crash, domain health data appears.

**Step 4: Commit**

```bash
cd ~/projects/ai-agents
git add cockpit/widgets/sidebar.py cockpit/app.py
git commit -m "feat: domain health in cockpit sidebar — sufficiency bars + momentum"
```

### Task 13: Add Emergence Nudges

**Files:**
- Modify: `~/projects/logos/data/nudges.py`
- Test: `~/projects/tests/test_nudges.py`

**Step 1: Write the failing test**

Add to `~/projects/tests/test_nudges.py`:

```python
class TestEmergenceNudges:
    def test_emergence_candidates_produce_nudges(self) -> None:
        """Active emergence candidates generate nudges."""
        from cockpit.data.nudges import Nudge
        nudges: list[Nudge] = []
        # We can't easily mock this, but we can verify the collector exists
        from cockpit.data.nudges import _collect_emergence_nudges
        _collect_emergence_nudges(nudges)
        # Should not crash — may produce 0 nudges if no candidates
        assert isinstance(nudges, list)
```

**Step 2: Implement emergence nudge collector**

In `~/projects/logos/data/nudges.py`, add a new collector function before `collect_nudges()`:

```python
def _collect_emergence_nudges(nudges: list[Nudge]) -> None:
    """Generate nudges from emergence detection candidates."""
    try:
        from cockpit.data.emergence import collect_emergence
        snapshot = collect_emergence()
        for candidate in snapshot.candidates:
            nudges.append(Nudge(
                category="emergence",
                priority_score=55,
                priority_label="medium",
                title=f"Potential new domain: {candidate.label}",
                detail=(
                    f"{candidate.event_count} activities over {candidate.week_span} weeks. "
                    f"Keywords: {', '.join(candidate.top_keywords[:3])}"
                ),
                suggested_action=f"/domain propose {candidate.candidate_id}",
                command_hint="",
                source_id=f"emergence:{candidate.candidate_id}",
            ))
    except Exception:
        pass
```

In `collect_nudges()`, add the call after `_collect_knowledge_sufficiency_nudges`:

```python
    _collect_emergence_nudges(nudges)
```

**Step 3: Run tests**

```bash
cd ~/projects/ai-agents
uv run pytest tests/test_nudges.py -v
```

Expected: All PASS

**Step 4: Commit**

```bash
cd ~/projects/ai-agents
git add logos/data/nudges.py tests/test_nudges.py
git commit -m "feat: emergence nudges — surface domain candidates in action items"
```

---

### Task 14: Final Verification

**Step 1: Run all knowledge sufficiency tests**

```bash
cd ~/projects/ai-agents
uv run pytest tests/test_knowledge_sufficiency.py -v
```

Expected: All PASS

**Step 2: Run all new test files**

```bash
cd ~/projects/ai-agents
uv run pytest tests/test_momentum.py tests/test_emergence.py tests/test_domain_health.py -v
```

Expected: All PASS

**Step 3: Run full test suite**

```bash
cd ~/projects/ai-agents
uv run pytest tests/ -v --timeout=60
```

Expected: All PASS (may have 1 pre-existing failure)

**Step 4: Verify YAML files load correctly**

```bash
cd ~/projects/hapaxromana
python3 -c "
import yaml
for f in ['domains/registry.yaml', 'knowledge/management-sufficiency.yaml', 'knowledge/music-sufficiency.yaml', 'knowledge/personal-sufficiency.yaml', 'knowledge/technical-sufficiency.yaml']:
    with open(f) as fh:
        data = yaml.safe_load(fh)
        if 'domains' in data:
            print(f'{f}: {len(data[\"domains\"])} domains')
        elif 'requirements' in data:
            print(f'{f}: {len(data[\"requirements\"])} requirements')
"
```

Expected output:
```
domains/registry.yaml: 4 domains
knowledge/management-sufficiency.yaml: 31 requirements
knowledge/music-sufficiency.yaml: 6 requirements
knowledge/personal-sufficiency.yaml: 4 requirements
knowledge/technical-sufficiency.yaml: 5 requirements
```

**Step 5: Verify cockpit snapshot mode**

```bash
cd ~/projects/ai-agents
uv run logos --once 2>&1 | head -40
```

Expected: Domain health section visible, no crashes.

**Step 6: Update CLAUDE.md**

In `~/projects/hapaxromana/CLAUDE.md`, add the domain registry to the architecture documentation. In the description of hapaxromana, note that `domains/registry.yaml` defines life domains and `knowledge/*.yaml` has per-domain sufficiency models.

**Step 7: Commit documentation**

```bash
cd ~/projects/hapaxromana
git add CLAUDE.md
git commit -m "docs: add domain lattice engine to CLAUDE.md"
```
